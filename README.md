# NGS-Sequences to Counts_PFM_PSSM calculator

To calculate the Counts, PFM and PSSM from NGS sequencing data (amino acids)

List your reads as:

[Seq("Read1_amino acid_sequences",IUPAC.ExtendedIUPACProtein), 

 Seq("Read2_amino acid_sequences",IUPAC.ExtendedIUPACProtein),
 
 ...]
                                                           
Import as parameter "k"

The seqeunces listed in the file as examples are from selected TcpP variants (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.24.436753v1.full).
